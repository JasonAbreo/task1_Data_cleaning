## 🧼 Description
This dataset is a cleaned and preprocessed version of the original sales data. All data cleaning steps were performed manually using Microsoft Excel.

## ✅ Cleaning Summary

- Removed rows with missing values in essential columns (e.g., `order_number`, `order_date`, `country`).
- Removed duplicate rows based on key fields.
- Standardized text formatting (e.g., capitalized names, trimmed extra spaces).
- Converted `order_date` format to `dd-mm-yyyy`.
- Renamed column headers to lowercase with underscores (e.g., `Order Number` → `order_number`).
- Ensured numeric columns are properly formatted as numbers (e.g., `quantity_ordered`, `sales`).
